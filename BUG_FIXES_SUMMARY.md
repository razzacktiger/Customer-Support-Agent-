# Bug Fixes Summary

This document details the 3 bugs found and fixed in the codebase.

## Bug 1: Memory Leak in VapiWidget Component

### Location
`src/components/VapiWidget.tsx`

### Issue
The component was setting up event listeners in the `useEffect` hook but not properly cleaning them up when the component unmounts. This creates a memory leak where event handlers remain in memory even after the component is destroyed.

### Impact
- Memory consumption increases over time
- Potential performance degradation
- Could cause application crashes in long-running sessions
- Event handlers might fire on unmounted components causing errors

### Fix Applied
- Stored event handler functions in named variables
- Added proper cleanup in the `useEffect` return function to remove all event listeners using `vapiInstance.off()` before calling `stop()`
- This ensures all references are cleaned up when the component unmounts

## Bug 2: Missing Error Handling in vapi-proxy API Route

### Location
`src/app/api/vapi-proxy/route.ts`

### Issue
The API route had multiple critical issues:
1. No try-catch block around async operations
2. No validation of the input `action` parameter
3. No error handling for JSON parsing failures
4. No error handling for external API call failures
5. Missing checks for required environment variables

### Impact
- Server crashes on malformed JSON requests
- Potential security vulnerabilities from unvalidated input
- Poor error messages for clients
- Difficult debugging when external API fails
- Server errors when environment variables are missing

### Fix Applied
- Added comprehensive try-catch error handling
- Added input validation for the `action` parameter
- Added specific error handling for JSON parsing
- Added validation that action is either "start" or "end"
- Added checks for required environment variables
- Added proper error responses with appropriate HTTP status codes
- Added logging for debugging purposes

## Bug 3: Security Vulnerability - Client-Side API Key Exposure

### Location
`src/app/page.tsx` and `src/components/VapiWidget.tsx`

### Issue
The application was passing sensitive API keys (`NEXT_PUBLIC_VAPI_API_KEY` and `NEXT_PUBLIC_VAPI_ASSISTANT_ID`) directly to client-side components. Any environment variable prefixed with `NEXT_PUBLIC_` is exposed to the browser, making these credentials visible to anyone who inspects the JavaScript code.

### Impact
- **Critical Security Risk**: API keys exposed in browser
- Anyone can extract and misuse the API keys
- Potential for unauthorized API usage and billing
- Violation of security best practices
- Risk of data breaches

### Fix Applied
- Removed API key props from the `page.tsx` component
- Modified `VapiWidget` to not accept API keys as props
- Added TODO comments indicating the need for proper server-side authentication
- The widget now shows a message that backend configuration is required
- In production, this should use:
  - Server-side API proxy endpoints
  - Session-based authentication tokens
  - Never expose sensitive credentials to the client

## Additional Recommendations

1. **Implement Proper Authentication Flow**: Create a server-side endpoint that generates temporary, scoped tokens for the Vapi service instead of exposing API keys.

2. **Add Rate Limiting**: The vapi-proxy endpoint should implement rate limiting to prevent abuse.

3. **Add Request Logging**: Implement proper request logging for security auditing.

4. **Environment Variable Validation**: Use a schema validation library (like the one already in `src/config/env.ts`) to validate all required environment variables at startup.

5. **Security Headers**: Add security headers to API responses to prevent XSS and other attacks.

6. **Input Sanitization**: Add more robust input validation and sanitization throughout the application.
